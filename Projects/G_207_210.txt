#Car_Agency_Project
#2nd Year IEM Kolkata

There is a car agency that contains many kind of cars and each client give an order to buy a car. The car 

agency employees will search for the required car upon customers’ request in order (First come First 

Served). The car agency system has the following requirements:

A.There are many kinds of cars in the car agency’s inventory and inventory consists of at least ten cars. 
  There may be more than one cars for each kind.

B. The customers are organized as a Queue and served as FCFS basis.

C.  Retrieve data of the last sold car


So, we have to write a c code to implement all these things together using different data structures like linked list, stack and queue.
